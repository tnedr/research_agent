346,20,2001.0,2001-05-01,Dietary cholesterol from eggs increases the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in humans: a meta-analysis.,"R. Weggemans, P. Zock, M. Katan",American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,"BACKGROUND Several epidemiologic studies found no effect of egg consumption on the risk of coronary heart disease. It is possible that the adverse effect of eggs on LDL-cholesterol is offset by their favorable effect on HDL cholesterol. OBJECTIVE The objective was to review the effect of dietary cholesterol on the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. DESIGN Studies were identified by MEDLINE and Biological Abstracts searches (from 1974 to June 1999) and by reviewing reference lists. In addition, we included data from a more recently published study. Studies were included if they had a crossover or parallel design with a control group, if the experimental diets differed only in the amount of dietary cholesterol or number of eggs and were fed for > or =14 d, and if HDL-cholesterol concentrations were reported. Of the 222 studies identified, 17 studies involving 556 subjects met these criteria. RESULTS The addition of 100 mg dietary cholesterol/d increased the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol by 0.020 units (95% CI: 0.010, 0.030), total cholesterol concentrations by 0.056 mmol/L (2.2 mg/dL) (95% CI: 0.046, 0.065 mmol/L; 1.8, 2.5 mg/dL), and HDL-cholesterol concentrations by 0.008 mmol/L (0.3 mg/dL) (95% CI: 0.005, 0.010 mmol/L; 0.2, 0.4 mg/dL). CONCLUSIONS Dietary cholesterol raises the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and, therefore, adversely affects the cholesterol profile. The advice to limit cholesterol intake by reducing consumption of eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods may therefore still be valid.","Dietary cholesterol raises the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and, therefore, adversely affects the cholesterol profile, and the advice to limit cholesterol intake by reducing consumption of eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods may still be valid.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7660cf4d0d096ab585462f89b6c1cb0fc0d2d4c9,https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-pdf/73/5/885/23962934/885.pdf,eggs cholesterol heart disease review,14.416666666666666,0.2549742078113485,0.3235294117647059,0.0212478506509457,0.1820502261331946,0.9,meta-analysis,"The paper is about dietary cholesterol from eggs and its impact on cardiovascular health, which is directly related to the research topic."
74,4,2004.0,2004-12-01,A Review of Scientific Research and Recommendations Regarding Eggs,S. Kritchevsky,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,"For much of the past 40 years, the public has been warned away from eggs because of a concern over coronary heart disease risk. This concern is based on three observations: 1. eggs are a rich source of dietary cholesterol; 2. when fed experimentally, dietary cholesterol increases serum cholesterol and; 3. high serum cholesterol predicts the onset of coronary heart disease. However, data from free-living populations show that egg consumption is not associated with higher cholesterol levels. Furthermore, as a whole, the epidemiologic literature does not support the idea that egg consumption is a risk factor for coronary disease. Within the nutritional community there is a growing appreciation that health derives from an overall pattern of diet rather than from the avoidance of particular foods, and there has been a shift in the tone in recent dietary recommendations away from “avoidance” messages to ones that promote healthy eating patterns. The most recent American Heart Association guidelines no longer include a recommendation to limit egg consumption, but recommend the adoption of eating practices associated with good health. Based on the epidemiologic evidence, there is no reason to think that such a healthy eating pattern could not include eggs.","The most recent American Heart Association guidelines no longer include a recommendation to limit egg consumption, but recommend the adoption of eating practices associated with good health, and there is no reason to think that such a healthy eating pattern could not include eggs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba7a73c41c76d275a772900a49e44891cf151fad,,eggs cholesterol heart disease review,3.523809523809524,0.0545320560058953,0.4117647058823529,0.0051935291434186,0.1419664402238419,0.9,Review,Directly discusses eggs and cardiovascular health
