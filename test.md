### Egg Consumption and Coronary Heart Disease: An Epidemiologic Overview (2000.0):

#### Key Findings:
- Cholesterol intake was associated with a modest increase in the risk of coronary events.
- The association between cholesterol intake and heart disease risk was small (6% increase in risk for 200mg/1,000kcal/day difference in cholesterol intake).
- No association was seen between egg consumption at levels up to 1+ egg per day and the risk of coronary heart disease in non-diabetic men and women.

**Methodology:** This is a review study that analyzed epidemiologic data relating dietary cholesterol and eggs to coronary disease risk. The study considered a full-range of confounding factors to estimate the association between cholesterol intake and heart disease risk.

**Limitations:** The study acknowledges that the true magnitude of the association between cholesterol intake and heart disease risk is difficult to estimate because most studies fail to account for potential confounding by other features of the diet. Also, all but one of the studies reviewed failed to consider the role of other potentially confounding dietary factors when examining egg intake and its relationship with coronary outcomes.

**Contribution:** This paper contributes to our understanding of the topic by providing evidence that egg consumption at levels up to 1+ egg per day does not increase the risk of coronary heart disease in non-diabetic men and women. It also highlights the importance of considering other dietary factors when studying the relationship between specific foods and disease risk.

**Relevance:** This paper is relevant to the research topic as it directly investigates the relationship between egg consumption (a source of dietary cholesterol) and coronary heart disease. It provides insights into the health effects of eggs on cardiovascular health.

### Dietary cholesterol from eggs increases the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in humans: a meta-analysis. (2001.0):

#### Key Findings:
- Dietary cholesterol raises the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol
- Dietary cholesterol increases total cholesterol concentrations by 0.056 mmol/L (2.2 mg/dL)
- Dietary cholesterol increases HDL-cholesterol concentrations by 0.008 mmol/L (0.3 mg/dL)
- The advice to limit cholesterol intake by reducing consumption of eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods may still be valid

**Methodology:** The researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 17 studies involving 556 subjects. The studies were identified through MEDLINE and Biological Abstracts searches and by reviewing reference lists. The studies included had a crossover or parallel design with a control group, and the experimental diets differed only in the amount of dietary cholesterol or number of eggs and were fed for more than 14 days. HDL-cholesterol concentrations were reported in all studies.

**Limitations:** The study only included research that reported HDL-cholesterol concentrations, potentially excluding relevant studies that did not report this specific measure. Additionally, the study did not consider other dietary factors that could influence cholesterol levels. The study also relied on previously published research, which may have varied in quality and methodology.

**Contribution:** This research contributes to our understanding of the topic by providing a comprehensive analysis of the impact of dietary cholesterol on cholesterol levels and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. It suggests that dietary cholesterol, and therefore egg consumption, may adversely affect these indicators of cardiovascular health.

**Relevance:** This research is directly relevant to the topic of the health effects of eggs on cardiovascular health. It specifically investigates the impact of dietary cholesterol, which is found in eggs, on cholesterol levels and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol, which are key indicators of cardiovascular health.

### A Review of Scientific Research and Recommendations Regarding Eggs (2004.0):

#### Key Findings:
- Egg consumption is not associated with higher cholesterol levels in free-living populations.
- The epidemiologic literature does not support the idea that egg consumption is a risk factor for coronary disease.
- The most recent American Heart Association guidelines no longer include a recommendation to limit egg consumption.

**Methodology:** This is a review study that analyzed previous research and recommendations regarding egg consumption and its effects on cardiovascular health.

**Limitations:** The study is based on a review of existing literature and does not conduct any new experimental research. It also does not provide specific details about the studies it reviewed, such as their sample sizes, methodologies, or potential biases.

**Contribution:** This paper contributes to our understanding of the topic by providing a comprehensive review of the existing literature on egg consumption and cardiovascular health. It challenges the traditional view that eggs are harmful to cardiovascular health and suggests that eggs can be part of a healthy eating pattern.

**Relevance:** The paper directly addresses the research topic by examining the relationship between egg consumption and cardiovascular health. It provides a comprehensive review of existing research and presents key findings that challenge the traditional view that eggs are harmful to cardiovascular health.

### Unscrambling the research: Eggs, serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease (2007.0):

#### Key Findings:
- An increase in dietary cholesterol from eggs by 100 mg daily, equivalent to half a medium egg or three to four eggs a week, results in an increase of approximately 0.05 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol.
- Adding 100 mg of cholesterol per day (equivalent to three to four eggs a week) to a high saturated fat diet caused an increase in LDL cholesterol of 0.061 0.006 mmol/L, whereas adding the same quantity of cholesterol to a low saturated fat diet caused an increase in LDL cholesterol of only 0.036 0.004 mmol/L.
- Despite the small increase in LDL-cholesterol levels with increasing egg intake, most epidemiological studies have shown little or no association between egg intake and risk of coronary heart disease.
- There is insufficient evidence to excessively restrict egg intake in a healthy Western population and eggs should be considered in a similar way as other protein-rich foods and selected as part of a varied diet that is low in saturated fat and contains a variety of cardio-protective foods.

**Methodology:** This is a review paper, which means it synthesizes the findings of multiple studies on the topic of eggs, serum cholesterol, and coronary heart disease. The authors evaluated the literature to address the effects of dietary cholesterol from eggs on serum cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease.

**Limitations:** The paper acknowledges that the impact of dietary cholesterol for people with type 2 diabetes has been poorly studied. This suggests that the findings may not be applicable to all populations. Additionally, as a review paper, the findings are dependent on the quality and scope of the studies included in the review.

**Contribution:** This paper contributes to our understanding of the topic by providing a comprehensive review of the existing literature on the health effects of eggs on cardiovascular health. It challenges the common perception that eggs, due to their high cholesterol content, are detrimental to cardiovascular health. Instead, it suggests that in the context of a varied diet low in saturated fat, eggs may not significantly increase the risk of coronary heart disease.

**Relevance:** This paper is directly relevant to the research topic as it investigates the health effects of eggs, specifically their impact on serum cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease. It provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature on the topic, offering a balanced perspective on the potential health impacts of egg consumption.

### Rethinking dietary cholesterol (2012.0):

#### Key Findings:
- Dietary cholesterol is not correlated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD).
- Dietary cholesterol challenges may increase plasma LDL cholesterol in certain individuals, who are more sensitive to dietary cholesterol (about one-quarter of the population), HDL cholesterol also rises resulting in the maintenance of the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, a key marker of CHD risk.
- The lines of evidence coming from current epidemiological studies and from clinical interventions utilizing different types of cholesterol challenges support the notion that the recommendations limiting dietary cholesterol should be reconsidered.

**Methodology:** This is a review study that analyzed recent evidence challenging the current dietary restrictions regarding cholesterol. It also examined the beneficial effects of eggs (an icon for dietary cholesterol) in healthy individuals. The study utilized data from current epidemiological studies and clinical interventions.

**Limitations:** The study is a review and therefore does not present new experimental data. It relies on the quality and accuracy of the studies it reviews. Additionally, the study does not provide specific data on the health effects of eggs on cardiovascular health, but rather discusses dietary cholesterol in general.

**Contribution:** This study contributes to our understanding of the topic by providing a different perspective on the relationship between dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular health. It suggests that the current guidelines limiting dietary cholesterol intake may need to be reconsidered, which could have implications for the consumption of eggs.

**Relevance:** This study is relevant to the research topic as it challenges the current understanding and dietary guidelines regarding cholesterol, which is a key component of eggs. It provides evidence that dietary cholesterol, and by extension eggs, may not be as harmful to cardiovascular health as previously thought.

### Dietary Intakes of Eggs and Cholesterol in Relation to All‐Cause and Heart Disease Mortality: A Prospective Cohort Study (2020.0):

#### Key Findings:
- No significant association was found between egg consumption and mortality in US adults.
- The association between dietary cholesterol intake and all‐cause mortality depended on the baseline intake levels, with an inverse association in those with lower intake levels (<250 mg/day) but a positive association in those with higher intake levels (≥250 mg/day).
- No significant association was found between dietary cholesterol intake and heart disease mortality.

**Methodology:** This was a prospective cohort study that used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2014, which included 37,121 participants aged 20 years and above. Dietary information was assessed via 24‐hour dietary recalls at baseline. Mortality status was documented until December 31, 2015. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations between dietary intakes of eggs and cholesterol and all‐cause and heart disease mortality.

**Limitations:** The study relied on self-reported dietary recalls, which may be subject to recall bias. The study also did not account for changes in dietary habits over time. Furthermore, the study did not differentiate between different types of eggs (e.g., free-range, organic, etc.) or cooking methods, which could potentially influence the health effects of eggs.

**Contribution:** This study contributes to our understanding of the topic by providing evidence that egg consumption does not significantly affect mortality rates, including heart disease mortality, in US adults. It also suggests that the impact of dietary cholesterol intake on all-cause mortality may depend on the baseline intake levels.

**Relevance:** This study is relevant to the research topic as it directly investigates the association between egg consumption, dietary cholesterol intake, and mortality, including heart disease mortality, in a large US population.

### Dietary cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients: a review of the Harvard Egg Study and other data (2009.0):

#### Key Findings:
- The original studies showing a linear relation between cholesterol intake and coronary heart disease (CHD) may have contained fundamental study design flaws.
- Newer trials have shown that consumption of up to seven eggs per week is harmonious with a healthful diet, except in male patients with diabetes for whom an association in higher egg intake and CHD was shown.
- The degree to which serum cholesterol is increased by dietary cholesterol depends upon whether the individual’s cholesterol synthesis is stimulated or down‐regulated by such increased intake, and the extent to which each of these phenomena occurs varies from person to person.

**Methodology:** This is a review paper that analyzed previous studies on the topic. The paper specifically mentions the Harvard Egg Study conducted by Frank B. Hu of the Harvard School of Public Health in 1999.

**Limitations:** As a review paper, the findings are dependent on the quality and accuracy of the studies reviewed. The paper acknowledges that earlier studies may have had design flaws, including conflated cholesterol and saturated fat consumption rates and inaccurately assessed dietary intake of fats. The paper also notes that the effects of dietary cholesterol can vary from person to person.

**Contribution:** This paper contributes to our understanding of the topic by challenging the previously held belief that there is a direct, linear relationship between cholesterol intake and CHD. It highlights the complexity of cholesterol homeostasis and the development of CHD, and suggests that the effects of dietary cholesterol can vary from person to person. It also identifies a potential risk group, male patients with diabetes, for whom higher egg intake may be associated with CHD.

**Relevance:** This paper is directly relevant to the research topic as it reviews studies on the relationship between dietary cholesterol, specifically from egg consumption, and cardiovascular health.

### Egg Consumption and Human Cardio-Metabolic Health in People with and without Diabetes (2015.0):

#### Key Findings:
- The evidence suggests that a diet including more eggs than is recommended may be used safely as part of a healthy diet in both the general population and for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease, those with established coronary heart disease, and those with T2DM.
- The disparity between dietary guidelines is at least in part related to the conflicting evidence as to the effects of eggs in the general population and in those with T2DM.

**Methodology:** This is a review paper, which means it synthesizes the findings of multiple studies on the topic of egg consumption and cardiovascular health. The authors have examined both epidemiological research and controlled prospective studies.

**Limitations:** As a review paper, the findings are dependent on the quality and scope of the studies included in the review. The paper does not provide new experimental data, but rather interprets existing research. The paper also acknowledges that there is conflicting evidence on the topic, which may limit the conclusiveness of the findings.

**Contribution:** This paper contributes to our understanding of the topic by suggesting that egg consumption may not be as harmful to cardiovascular health as previously thought, even for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease. It also highlights the need for dietary guidelines to focus on a person's entire dietary intake rather than specific foods or nutrients.

**Relevance:** This paper is directly relevant to the research topic as it specifically addresses the health effects of eggs on cardiovascular health. It provides a comprehensive overview of the current research on the topic, including both epidemiological and controlled studies.
