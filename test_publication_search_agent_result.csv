Martin",Circulation,"Background: The American Heart Association, in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, annually reports the most up-to-date statistics related to heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular risk factors, including core health behaviors (smoking, physical activity, diet, and weight) and health factors (cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose control) that contribute to cardiovascular health. The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). Methods: The American Heart Association, through its Epidemiology and Prevention Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update with review of published literature through the year before writing. The 2023 Statistical Update is the product of a full year’s worth of effort in 2022 by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. The American Heart Association strives to further understand and help heal health problems inflicted by structural racism, a public health crisis that can significantly damage physical and mental health and perpetuate disparities in access to health care, education, income, housing, and several other factors vital to healthy lives. This year’s edition includes additional COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) publications, as well as data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, with an enhanced focus on health equity across several key domains. Results: Each of the chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics. Conclusions: The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policymakers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.","This year’s edition includes additional COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) publications, as well as data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, with an enhanced focus on health equity across several key domains.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/833f7bd8f145bf3ead5e206b47578f54a90e14c9,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001123,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

Fryer, U. Kadam, C. Chew‐Graham, M. Mamas",Circulation. Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes,"Background— Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder resulting in hypertension and multiorgan dysfunction. There is growing evidence that these effects persist after pregnancy. We aimed to systematically evaluate and quantify the evidence on the relationship between preeclampsia and the future risk of cardiovascular diseases. Methods and Results— We studied the future risk of heart failure, coronary heart disease, composite cardiovascular disease, death because of coronary heart or cardiovascular disease, stroke, and stroke death after preeclampsia. A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify relevant studies. We used random-effects meta-analysis to determine the risk. Twenty-two studies were identified with >6.4 million women including >258 000 women with preeclampsia. Meta-analysis of studies that adjusted for potential confounders demonstrated that preeclampsia was independently associated with an increased risk of future heart failure (risk ratio [RR], 4.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09–8.38), coronary heart disease (RR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.43–4.37), cardiovascular disease death (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.83–2.66), and stroke (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.29–2.55). Sensitivity analyses showed that preeclampsia continued to be associated with an increased risk of future coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke after adjusting for age (RR, 3.89; 95% CI, 1.83–8.26), body mass index (RR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.41–7.07), and diabetes mellitus (RR, 4.19; 95% CI, 2.09–8.38). Conclusions— Preeclampsia is associated with a 4-fold increase in future incident heart failure and a 2-fold increased risk in coronary heart disease, stroke, and death because of coronary heart or cardiovascular disease. Our study highlights the importance of lifelong monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia.","Preeclampsia is associated with a 4-fold increase in future incident heart failure and a 2-fold increased risk in coronary heart disease, stroke, and death because of coronary heart or cardiovascular disease.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0341a86781df4a1a114605145995686b08b70868,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.116.003497,eggs cardiovascular health meta-analysis

Katan",American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,"BACKGROUND Several epidemiologic studies found no effect of egg consumption on the risk of coronary heart disease. It is possible that the adverse effect of eggs on LDL-cholesterol is offset by their favorable effect on HDL cholesterol. OBJECTIVE The objective was to review the effect of dietary cholesterol on the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. DESIGN Studies were identified by MEDLINE and Biological Abstracts searches (from 1974 to June 1999) and by reviewing reference lists. In addition, we included data from a more recently published study. Studies were included if they had a crossover or parallel design with a control group, if the experimental diets differed only in the amount of dietary cholesterol or number of eggs and were fed for > or =14 d, and if HDL-cholesterol concentrations were reported. Of the 222 studies identified, 17 studies involving 556 subjects met these criteria. RESULTS The addition of 100 mg dietary cholesterol/d increased the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol by 0.020 units (95% CI: 0.010, 0.030), total cholesterol concentrations by 0.056 mmol/L (2.2 mg/dL) (95% CI: 0.046, 0.065 mmol/L; 1.8, 2.5 mg/dL), and HDL-cholesterol concentrations by 0.008 mmol/L (0.3 mg/dL) (95% CI: 0.005, 0.010 mmol/L; 0.2, 0.4 mg/dL). CONCLUSIONS Dietary cholesterol raises the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and, therefore, adversely affects the cholesterol profile. The advice to limit cholesterol intake by reducing consumption of eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods may therefore still be valid.","Dietary cholesterol raises the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and, therefore, adversely affects the cholesterol profile, and the advice to limit cholesterol intake by reducing consumption of eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods may still be valid.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7660cf4d0d096ab585462f89b6c1cb0fc0d2d4c9,https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-pdf/73/5/885/23962934/885.pdf,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

Kritchevsky",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,"Serum cholesterol has been established as a modifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease. Experimental feeding studies show that saturated fat and cholesterol increase serum cholesterol levels; thus, dietary recommendations for lowering the risk of heart disease proscribe the intake of both substances. Recommendations have also included limits on the intake of eggs because of their high cholesterol content. In free-living populations, diet reflects a pattern of associated choices. Increases in one food may lead to changes in the consumption of other foods that may modulate disease risk. Epidemiologic data are helpful in assessing the importance of foods and nutrients in the context in which they are actually consumed. We review epidemiologic data relating dietary cholesterol and eggs to coronary disease risk. Cholesterol intake was associated with a modest increase in the risk of coronary events. The true magnitude of the association is difficult to estimate because most studies fail to account for potential confounding by other features of the diet. When a full-range of confounding factors was considered, the association between cholesterol intake and heart disease risk was small (6% increase in risk for 200mg/1,000kcal/day difference in cholesterol intake). Several studies have examined egg intake and its relationship with coronary outcomes. All but one failed to consider the role of other potentially confounding dietary factors. When dietary confounders were considered, no association was seen between egg consumption at levels up to 1+ egg per day and the risk of coronary heart disease in non-diabetic men and women.",,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/92c63d1f28ddeb505d3d1924eb78b418e60108d0,None,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

74,4,2004.0,2004-12-01,A Review of Scientific Research and Recommendations Regarding Eggs,S. Kritchevsky,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,"For much of the past 40 years, the public has been warned away from eggs because of a concern over coronary heart disease risk. This concern is based on three observations: 1. eggs are a rich source of dietary cholesterol; 2. when fed experimentally, dietary cholesterol increases serum cholesterol and; 3. high serum cholesterol predicts the onset of coronary heart disease. However, data from free-living populations show that egg consumption is not associated with higher cholesterol levels. Furthermore, as a whole, the epidemiologic literature does not support the idea that egg consumption is a risk factor for coronary disease. Within the nutritional community there is a growing appreciation that health derives from an overall pattern of diet rather than from the avoidance of particular foods, and there has been a shift in the tone in recent dietary recommendations away from “avoidance” messages to ones that promote healthy eating patterns. The most recent American Heart Association guidelines no longer include a recommendation to limit egg consumption, but recommend the adoption of eating practices associated with good health. Based on the epidemiologic evidence, there is no reason to think that such a healthy eating pattern could not include eggs.","The most recent American Heart Association guidelines no longer include a recommendation to limit egg consumption, but recommend the adoption of eating practices associated with good health, and there is no reason to think that such a healthy eating pattern could not include eggs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba7a73c41c76d275a772900a49e44891cf151fad,None,eggs cholesterol heart disease review
56,2,2012.0,2012-03-01,Rethinking dietary cholesterol,M. Fernández,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,"Purpose of reviewThe perceived notion that dietary cholesterol is associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) has led to dietary recommendations of no more than 300 mg/day for healthy populations in the USA. This study will review the recent evidence that challenges the current dietary restrictions regarding cholesterol while it presents some beneficial effects of eggs (an icon for dietary cholesterol) in healthy individuals. Recent findingsThe European countries, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Korea and India among others do not have an upper limit for cholesterol intake in their dietary guidelines. Further, existing epidemiological data have clearly demonstrated that dietary cholesterol is not correlated with increased risk for CHD. Although numerous clinical studies have shown that dietary cholesterol challenges may increase plasma LDL cholesterol in certain individuals, who are more sensitive to dietary cholesterol (about one-quarter of the population), HDL cholesterol also rises resulting in the maintenance of the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, a key marker of CHD risk. SummaryThe lines of evidence coming from current epidemiological studies and from clinical interventions utilizing different types of cholesterol challenges support the notion that the recommendations limiting dietary cholesterol should be reconsidered.",The lines of evidence coming from current epidemiological studies and from clinical interventions utilizing different types of cholesterol challenges support the notion that the recommendations limiting dietary cholesterol should be reconsidered.,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31bc76057ac190543cd403fef0d73d1a559d2ab9,None,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

Markovic",Nutrients,"The guidelines for dietary cholesterol and/or egg intake for both the general population and those at higher risk of cardiovascular disease (for example, people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)) differ between countries, and even for different specialist societies in a country. The disparity between these guidelines is at least in part related to the conflicting evidence as to the effects of eggs in the general population and in those with T2DM. This review addresses the effect of eggs on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk from both epidemiological research and controlled prospective studies, in people with and without cardio-metabolic disease. It also examines the nutritional qualities of eggs and whether they may offer protection against chronic disease. The evidence suggests that a diet including more eggs than is recommended (at least in some countries) may be used safely as part of a healthy diet in both the general population and for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease, those with established coronary heart disease, and those with T2DM. In conclusion, an approach focused on a person’s entire dietary intake as opposed to specific foods or nutrients should be the heart of population nutrition guidelines.","The evidence suggests that a diet including more eggs than is recommended may be used safely as part of a healthy diet in both the general population and for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease, those with established coronary heart disease, and those with T2DM.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01845415d1d68356ffab5041add23115a76d9d7c,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/7/9/5344/pdf?version=1441280991,eggs cholesterol heart disease review
42,0,2009.0,2009-09-14,Dietary cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients: a review of the Harvard Egg Study and other data,P. Jones,International journal of clinical practice. Supplement,"For many years, both the medical community and the general public have incorrectly associated eggs with high serum cholesterol and being deleterious to health, even though cholesterol is an essential component of cells and organisms. It is now acknowledged that the original studies purporting to show a linear relation between cholesterol intake and coronary heart disease (CHD) may have contained fundamental study design flaws, including conflated cholesterol and saturated fat consumption rates and inaccurately assessed actual dietary intake of fats by study subjects. Newer and more accurate trials, such as that conducted by Frank B. Hu of the Harvard School of Public Health (1999), have shown that consumption of up to seven eggs per week is harmonious with a healthful diet, except in male patients with diabetes for whom an association in higher egg intake and CHD was shown. The degree to which serum cholesterol is increased by dietary cholesterol depends upon whether the individual’s cholesterol synthesis is stimulated or down‐regulated by such increased intake, and the extent to which each of these phenomena occurs varies from person to person. Several recent studies have shed additional light on the specific interplay between dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular health risk. It is evident that the dynamics of cholesterol homeostasis, and of development of CHD, are extremely complex and multifactorial. In summary, the earlier purported adverse relationship between dietary cholesterol and heart disease risk was likely largely over‐exaggerated.","It is admitted that the original studies purporting to show a linear relation between cholesterol intake and coronary heart disease (CHD) may have contained fundamental study design flaws, including conflated cholesterol and saturated fat consumption rates and inaccurately assessed actual dietary intake of fats by study subjects.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0b39ed40f687257b0291a038a476c190e3677af,None,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

Santi",PLoS ONE,"A moderate alcohol consumption is demonstrated to exert a protective action in terms of cardiovascular risk. Although this property seems not to be beverage-specific, the various composition of alcoholic compounds could mediate peculiar effects in vivo. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential beer-mediated effects on the cardiovascular health in humans, using a meta-analytic approach (trial registration number: CRD42018118387). The literature search, comprising all English articles published until November, 30th 2019 in EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane database included all controlled clinical trials evaluating the cardiovascular effects of beer assumption compared to alcohol-free beer, water, abstinence or placebo. Both sexes and all beer preparations were considered eligible. Outcome parameters were those entering in the cardiovascular risk charts and those related to endothelial dysfunction. Twenty-six trials were included in the analysis. Total cholesterol was significantly higher in beer drinkers compared to controls (14 studies, 3.52 mg/dL, 1.71–5.32 mg/dL). Similar increased levels were observed in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (18 studies, 3.63 mg/dL, 2.00–5.26 mg/dL) and in apolipoprotein A1 (5 studies, 0.16 mg/dL, 0.11–0.21 mg/dL), while no differences were detected in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (12 studies, -2.85 mg/dL, -5.96–0.26 mg/dL) and triglycerides (14 studies, 0.40 mg/dL, -5.00–5.80 mg/dL) levels. Flow mediated dilation (FMD) resulted significantly higher in beer-consumers compared to controls (4 studies, 0.65%, 0.07–1.23%), while blood pressure and other biochemical markers of inflammation did not differ. In conclusion, the specific beer effect on human cardiovascular health was meta-analysed for the first time, highlighting an improvement of the vascular elasticity, detected by the increase of FMD (after acute intake), and of the lipid profile with a significant increase of HDL and apolipoprotein A1 serum levels. Although the long-term effects of beer consumption are not still understood, a beneficial effect of beer on endothelial function should be supposed.","The specific beer effect on human cardiovascular health was meta-analysed for the first time, highlighting an improvement of the vascular elasticity, detected by the increase of FMD (after acute intake), and of the lipid profile with a significant increase of HDL and apolipoprotein A1 serum levels.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/76e459256dbb6957089cae215bd14c9f5c34f019,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233619&type=printable,eggs cardiovascular health meta-analysis

27,1,2007.0,2007-06-01,"Unscrambling the research: Eggs, serum cholesterol and coronary heart disease","S. Natoli, T. Markovic, David Lim, M. Noakes, K. Kostner",,"The role of dietary cholesterol in raising plasma cholesterol levels has been debated over the past 25 years. Consequently, eggs, as a food high in dietary cholesterol, have been targeted as a food to limit when advising patients on a diet to lower serum cholesterol levels. The aim of the present review was to evaluate the literature to address the effects of dietary cholesterol from eggs on serum cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease. An increase in dietary cholesterol from eggs by 100 mg daily, equivalent to half a medium egg or three to four eggs a week, results in an increase of approximately 0.05 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol. Adding 100 mg of cholesterol per day (equivalent to three to four eggs a week) to a high saturated fat diet caused an increase in LDL cholesterol of 0.061 0.006 mmol/L, whereas adding the same quantity of cholesterol to a low saturated fat diet caused an increase in LDL cholesterol of only 0.036 0.004 mmol/L (P = 0.03). Despite the small increase in LDL-cholesterol levels with increasing egg intake, most epidemiological studies have shown little or no association between egg intake and risk of coronary heart disease. However, the impact of dietary cholesterol for people with type 2 diabetes has been poorly studied. In conclusion, in a healthy Western population, there is insufficient evidence to excessively restrict egg intake as part of a healthy diet. Eggs should be considered in a similar way as other protein-rich foods and selected as part of a varied diet that is low in saturated fat and contains a variety of cardio-protective foods such as fish, wholegrains, fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts.",There is insufficient evidence to excessively restrict egg intake in a healthy Western population and eggs should be considered in a similar way as other protein-rich foods and selected as part of a varied diet that is low in saturated fat and contains a variety of cardio-protective foods.,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7e2d4c1ce0fb367cf28e9ff3da1e5f648c3cd0b,None,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

23,1,2003.0,,[Nutrition and health--potential health benefits and risks of vegetarianism and limited consumption of meat in the Netherlands].,Pieter C. Dagnelie,Nederlandsch tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,"In the latest Dutch national food consumption survey (1998) just over 1% of subjects (about 150,000 persons) claimed to be vegetarians; however, a much larger group (6% or approximately 1 million persons) ate meat < or = once a week. Vegetarianism can be subdivided into lacto-vegetarianism (a diet without meat and fish) and veganism (a diet without any animal foods whatsoever, including dairy products and eggs). A recent meta-analysis showed that vegetarians had a lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease than omniovorous subjects; however, cancer mortality and total mortality did not differ. Although a high consumption of red meat, which is rich in haeme iron and saturated fat, may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and some types of cancer, this does not apply to white meat and fish. In fact, the most important protective effect would seem to be derived from the consumption of unrefined vegetable products (whole-grain cereals, vegetables, fruits, nuts and legumes) and fish. In other words, a prudent, omnivorous diet with moderate amounts of animal products, in which red meat is partly replaced by white meat and fish (especially fatty fish), together with the consumption of ample amounts of unrefined vegetable products, is thought to be just as protective as a vegetarian diet. On the other hand, the omission of meat and fish from the diet increases the risk of nutritional deficiencies. A vegan diet, in particular, leads to a strongly increased risk of deficiencies of vitamin B12, vitamin B2 and several minerals, such as calcium, iron and zinc. However, even a lacto-vegetarian diet produces an increased risk of deficiencies of vitamin B12 and possibly certain minerals, such as iron. Data from the latest Dutch food consumption survey suggest that 5-10% of all inhabitants of the Netherlands (up to 1 million persons) actually have a vitamin B12 intake below recommended daily levels. In medical practice, the possibility of vitamin B12 deficiency in subjects consuming meat or fish < or = once a week deserves serious consideration. In case of doubt, evaluation is indicated using sensitive and specific deficiency markers such as the levels of methylmalonic acid in plasma or urine. Alternative dietary sources of vitamin B12 instead of meat are fish (especially fatty fish is a good source of vitamin B12), or a vitamin-B12-supplement.","A prudent, omnivorous diet with moderate amounts of animal products, in which red meat is partly replaced by white meat and fish, together with the consumption of ample amounts of unrefined vegetable products, is thought to be just as protective as a vegetarian diet.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5f1cec472e6618cb197eff88efb004ba871b9675,None,eggs cardiovascular health meta-analysis

Methods and Results Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2014 were used in this study, which included 37 121 participants ≥20 years of age. Dietary information was assessed via 24‐hour dietary recalls at baseline. Mortality status was documented until December 31, 2015. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations between dietary intakes of eggs and cholesterol and all‐cause and heart disease mortality. During a median follow‐up of 7.8 years, 4991 deaths were documented, including 870 deaths from heart disease. No significant association was observed between additional daily consumption of half an egg and all‐cause mortality (multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96–1.13), or heart disease mortality (0.96; 0.80–1.14). Each 50‐mg/day increase of cholesterol intake was inversely associated with all‐cause mortality among participants with daily intake <250 mg (0.87; 0.77–0.98), but positively associated with all‐cause mortality among participants with daily intake ≥250 mg (1.07; 1.01–1.12). No significant association was found between dietary cholesterol intake and heart disease mortality. Conclusions No significant association was found between egg consumption and mortality in US adults. The association between dietary cholesterol intake and all‐cause mortality depended on the baseline intake levels, with an inverse association in those with lower intake levels (<250 mg/day) but a positive association in those with higher intake levels (≥250 mg/day).","No significant association was found between egg consumption and mortality in US adults, and the association between dietary cholesterol intake and all‐cause mortality depended on the baseline intake levels, with an inverse association in those with lower intake levels (<250 mg/day but a positive association in Those with higher intake levels (≥250mg/day).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00c58917adb935af89c7d67fa06f3de686612234,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.119.015743,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

Michaud, R. Morgan",Noise and Health,"Background: Exposure to acute noise can cause an increase in biological stress reactions, which provides biological plausibility for a potential association between sustained noise exposure and stress-related health effects. However, the certainty in the evidence for an association between exposures to noise on short- and long-term biomarkers of stress has not been widely explored. The objective of this review was to evaluate the strength of evidence between noise exposure and changes in the biological parameters known to contribute to the development of stress-related adverse cardiovascular responses. Materials and Methods: This systematic review comprises English language comparative studies available in PubMed, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases from January 1, 1980 to December 29, 2021. Where possible, random-effects meta-analyses were used to examine the effect of noise exposure from various sources on stress-related cardiovascular biomarkers. The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the risk of bias of nonrandomized studies of exposures instrument. The certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: The search identified 133 primary studies reporting on blood pressure, hypertension, heart rate, cardiac arrhythmia, vascular resistance, and cardiac output. Meta-analyses of blood pressure, hypertension, and heart rate suggested there may be signals of increased risk in response to a higher noise threshold or incrementally higher levels of noise. Across all outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was very low due to concerns with the risk of bias, inconsistency across exposure sources, populations, and studies and imprecision in the estimates of effects. Conclusions: This review identifies that exposure to higher levels of noise may increase the risk of some short- and long-term cardiovascular events; however, the certainty of the evidence was very low. This likely represents the inability to compare across the totality of the evidence for each outcome, underscoring the value of continued research in this area. Findings from this review may be used to inform policies of noise reduction or mitigation interventions.","Exposure to higher levels of noise may increase the risk of some short- and long-term cardiovascular events; however, the certainty of the evidence was very low, underscoring the value of continued research in this area.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61f9da40d16887238215fbfb8c528dfd30135b3b,None,eggs cardiovascular health meta-analysis

Kengne, Denise L. Smith, E. Soteriades, R. November, L. Leach",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Background: Firefighting is a strenuous occupation, which necessitates that firefighters stay in good physical condition and maintain adequate cardiovascular and musculoskeletal fitness to perform their duties with minimal health and safety risks. The aim of this review is to determine the effects of cardiovascular disease risk factors, musculoskeletal health, and physical fitness on the occupational performance of firefighters. Methods: PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science, EBSCOHost, and ScienceDirect were searched without time-restriction.

Sidransky,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,"At the onset of this century, in 1909, a pathologist, Ignatowski,' was the first to provide a clear demonstration that diet affected the course of atherosclerosis. He observed that rabbits fed animal products, such as eggs, meat and milk, showed atheromas of the aorta which he attributed to the protein component of these foods. However, all of his dietary components contained cholesterol. In 1913, Anitschkow and Chalatow' reported that diets containing cholesterol in vegetable oil could produce atherosclerosis. This shifted research emphasis towards cholesterol and other lipids and away from proteins. Nonetheless, epidemiologic data3.4 relating diet to heart disease in 1957 revealed that the incidence of ischemic heart disease could be correlated with intake of animal protein as easily as with intake of fat. Since this review will focus predominantly on proteins and amino acids as possible influential factors in atherosclerosis, I plan to cover selected studies dealing with these dietary components. However, from the outset it is necessary to stress that whenever one dietary component is altered, it influences the effects or actions of other dietary components. Thus, an imbalanced state may be induced which then has diverse implications on the pathogenesis of disease states, especially one such as atherosclerosis. Thus, one simple alteration or rearrangement of amino acids in proteins can have considerable impact on the overall metabolism relating to many dietary components, which then can manifest itself with pathological lesions. Nutritional imbalances are induced by altering the quality and/or quantity of diet intake. Poor quality of essential foodstuffs induces a variety of pathological states, which in the past have mainly been considered under specific deficiency states. It has also been established that the quantity of intake will influence the pathological picture induced by the poor quality diet. In relation to amino acid deficient diets, the quantity of dietary intake influences the pathological responses in a variety of organ^.^ A human counterpart is the contrasting pathological findings in infants with marasmus versus those with kwashiorkor, where the amount of diet intake plays a major role. It might be worthwhile in this introduction to stress the importance of nutritional imbalance in relation to the quality as well as quantity of diet as influenced by dietary amino acids and proteins by citing some of our own earlier experimental studies dealing with amino acid deficient diets.5 We were concerned with the induction of experimental models of marasmus and kwashiorkor.

The role at omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially eicosa pentanoic acid (EPA) and decosahexaconic (DHA), has been associated with the prevention of degenerative disease. Breast milk and eggs fulfill the human requirement for DHA, however the DHA level is influenced by lactation levels and the maternal diet. Omega-3 PUFA are derived mainly from fish, eggs, and certain plants. Epidemiological observations, population studies, and basic research indicate the importance of these fatty acids for the membranes of the brain, for the retina in developing infants, and for the possibility of controlling coronary heart disease and other diseases by the ingestion of these fatty acids. Linolenic acid (LNA) enriched eggs may be an excellent source of dietary omega-3 PUFA and an ideal food ingredient for developing infants.","Empirical observations, population studies, and basic research indicate the importance of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for the membranes of the brain, for the retina in developing infants, and for the possibility of controlling coronary heart disease and other diseases by the ingestion of these fatty acids.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f0a8e3bb6d9fa09952c84bb5ecb659e46c513030,None,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

Kor, S. Tyrovolas, A. Leung",European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing,"AIM Despite the well-documented short to medium-term effectiveness of eHealth (electronic health) secondary prevention interventions on patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), there is limited empirical evidence regarding long-term effectiveness. This review aims to evaluate the long-term effects of eHealth secondary prevention interventions on the health outcomes of patients with CVD. METHODS AND RESULTS This systematic review and meta-analysis followed Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from 1990 to May 2022. Randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of eHealth secondary prevention on health outcomes of CVD patients that collected end-point data at ≥ 12 months were included. RevMan 5.3 was used for risk of bias assessment and meta-analysis. Ten trials with 1,559 participants were included. Data pooling suggested that eHealth programs have significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [n = 6; SMD = -0.26, 95%CI (-0.38, -0.14), I2 = 17%, p < .001]; systolic blood pressure [n = 5; SMD = -0.46, 95% CI, (-0.84, -0.08), I2 = 90%, p = 0.02]; and, re-hospitalization, reoccurrence, and mortality [RR = 0.36, 95% CI [0.17, 0.77], I2 = 0%, p = .009]. Effects on behavioral modification, physiological outcomes of body weight and blood glucose, and quality of life were inconclusive. CONCLUSION eHealth secondary prevention is effective in improving long-term management of risk factors and reducing the reoccurrence of cardiac events in patients with CVD. Results are inconclusive for behavior modification and quality of life. Exploring, implementing and strengthening strategies in eHealth secondary prevention programs that focus on maintaining behavior changes and enhancing psychosocial elements should be undertaken.

J. van der Beek, Pieter Coenen","Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health","Objectives Emerging evidence suggests contrasting health effects for leisure-time and occupational physical activity. In this systematic review, we synthesized and described the epidemiological evidence regarding the association between occupational physical activity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Methods A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, from database inception to 17 April 2020. Articles were included if they described original observational prospective research, assessing the association between occupational physical activity and CVD mortality among adult workers. Reviews were included if they controlled for age and gender and at least one other relevant variable. We performed meta-analyses on the associations between occupational physical activity and CVD mortality. Results We screened 3345 unique articles, and 31 articles (from 23 studies) were described in this review. In the meta-analysis, occupational physical activity showed no significant association with overall CVD mortality for both males [hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84–1.12] and females (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.82–1.15). Additional analysis showed that higher levels of occupational physical activity were non-significantly associated with a 9% increase in studies reporting on the outcome ischemic heart disease mortality (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.82–1.43). Conclusions While the beneficial association between leisure-time physical activity and CVD mortality has been widely documented, occupational physical activity was not found to have a beneficial association with CVD mortality. This observation may have implications for our appreciation of the association between physical activity and health for workers in physically demanding jobs, as occupational physical activity may not be health enhancing.","Occupational physical activity was not found to have a beneficial association with CVD mortality, which may have implications for appreciation of the association between physical activity and health for workers in physically demanding jobs, as occupational physical activity may not be health enhancing.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2633563385d1c37349029125a23dd46cf02a7faf,None,eggs cardiovascular health meta-analysis

Alexander et al. [1] performed a systematic review and metaanalysis to investigate the association between egg consumption and stroke as well as between egg consumption and coronary heart disease (CHD); they summarized that an egg consumption per day was associated with a decreased risk of stroke but not associated with an increased risk of CHD [1]. Another meta-analyses showed similar results; that is, that daily egg consumption was not associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in the general population [2,3]. However, Li et al. previously showed a dose–response effect between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease [4]. In Li et al.’s meta-analysis, each 4 incremental eggs consumption per week was associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD; relative risk [RR] D 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.10; p D 0.001) [4]. The effect of egg consumption on the risk of developing CVD was even more predominant in the patients with diabetes in other meta-analyses (RR D 1.40, 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.57, p < 0.001, in Li et al.’s study; RR D 1.69, 95% CI, 1.09–2.62 in Shin et al.’s study; RR D 1.54, 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.09, p D 0.01, in Rong et al.’s study) [2–4]. Although the relationship between dietary and serum cholesterol remains controversial, a few research works provided strong evidence of egg consumption and increased serum concentration of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Baumgartner et al. conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial for a period of 12 weeks to investigate the association between consumption of an additional egg per day and serum lipid concentration in apparently healthy women [5]. In Baumgartner et al.’s study, serum values of TC and LDL-C significantly increased by 9.3 and 6.6 mg/dl from baseline, respectively [5]. In Putadechakum et al.’s study, hyperlipidemic subjects (mainly women, 88.7%) not on lipidlowering therapy were randomized to have additional 1 or 3 eggs per day for an experimental period of 4 weeks [6]. Consumption of 1 additional egg daily increased serum values of TC and LDL-C by 9.6 and 7.7 mg/dl; the effects of increasing TC and LDL-C were even more pronounced in those subjects who consumed an additional 3 eggs daily (TC and LDL-C increased by 13.1 and 11.8 mg/dl, respectively). Rueda and Khosla conducted a study of college students that explored the effects of breakfast with or without egg on serum lipids for a study period of 14 weeks [7]. A large main effect of time (from week 8 to week 12) was significant for serum concentration of TC and LDL-C. At the end of the study, serum TC and LDL-C increased by 23 and 15 mg/dl in the egg group and changes in serum TC and LDL-C were 17 and 10 mg/dl in the no egg group [7]. In Severins et al.’s study, mildly hypercholesterolemic individuals were randomized to have milk plus one and half egg yolks for a study period of 12 weeks. Those individuals assigned to skim milk plus egg yolk had significantly higher TC and LDL-C values compared to baseline (TC and LDL-C increased by 12.4 and 9.3 mg/dl, respectively). Similarly, those patients who had buttermilk plus egg yolk also had significant increases in serum TC and LDL-C from baseline [8]. Egg consumption is positively associated with increased serum TC and LDL-C, thereby associating with the increased incidence of CHD mortality [9]. On the other hand, additional egg consumption had no effects of increased serum TC and LDL-C for subjects with hyperlipidemia already on statin treatment [10,11]. In Klangjareonchai et al.’s study, all hyperchelestrolemic individuals already on statin treatment (28.3% with rosuvastatin 5 mg/day, 20% with atorvastatin 10 mg/day, 51.7% with simvastatin 20 mg/day) consumed an additional 3 eggs for a period of 12 weeks and no significant changes in serum TC and LDL-C were observed at the end of the study [10]. Given that moderate-intensity statin predictably lowers serum LDL-C by approximately 32%–38% [12], consumption of an additional 3 eggs might neutralize the lipid-lowering effect of statin treatment in Klangjareonchai et al.’s study [10]. In other words, the benefit of lowering LDL-C by statin was mostly attenuated by additional eggs consumption. Taking egg consumption and coronary artery atherosclerotic burden into account, Choi et al.’s study [13] conducted a cross-sectional study and used a food frequency questionnaire to evaluate the number of eggs consumed in exceptionally healthy individuals. In Choi et al.’s study [13], consumption of more than 7 eggs vs less","Although the relationship between dietary and serum cholesterol remains controversial, a few research works provided strong evidence of egg consumption and increased serum concentration of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in apparently healthy women.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0e72ca1133e55dca519cefe9efd512848ac0c0d7,None,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

Turker Duyuler",Angiology,"In a comprehensive meta-analysis entitled “Egg Consumption and Coronary Artery Disease: A Nice Knockdown Argument,” Takagi et al evaluated 6 eligible studies (>1 million participants). Although these studies had some heterogeneity, the authors concluded that egg consumption is independently associated with low incidence/mortality of coronary artery disease (CAD) derived from the comparison of the most and the least eggconsuming groups. The authors also discussed that the quantity of egg consumed was not associated with the modification of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors such as blood pressure, lipids, and some lipoproteins. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were elevated despite the increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol levels following egg consumption. Beneficial effects of egg consumption were attributed to the rich content of antioxidants (eg, lutein and zeaxanthin) and a balanced glycemic response. On the other hand, in a recent meta-analysis, egg consumption was associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, C-reactive protein, and insulin resistance. This meta-analysis did not propose a daily or weekly healthy quantity of egg consumption. Association between egg consumption and low CAD incidence/mortality was possibly originating from the comparison of the fifth versus first quintile egg consumption; however, the upper limit of egg consumption is not clear. As in the case of exercise and HDL-C levels, after a certain point, beneficial effects of widely accepted CV protective measures may turn into CV risk factors. A possible J-curve between egg consumption and CAD incidence/mortality should also be kept in mind.

As a result, it was reported that the dietary intake cholesterol did not affected cholesterol levels in blood. Moreover, it was reported that adding two eggs a day to a healthful diet did not significantly increase blood cholesterol levels in young or middle-aged men and women with normal or even moderately elevated blood cholesterol levels. Cholesterol feeding studies demonstrate that dietary cholesterol increases both LDL and HDL cholesterol with little change in the LDL:HDL ratio as an important risk indicator of heart disease. Especially a good indicator in the elderly from increased HDL-cholesterol, so cholesterol intake appeared to be good for the prevention of heart disease. Thus the consumption of eggs is bad for your health is not known as a fact, but rather was found to be effective in preventing heart disease. Also, all consumers may consume without worrying because there are no official standards regarding egg intake.

However, the media hasn't shown the same enthusiasm for processed foods high in fructose, the consumption of refined cooking oil, seed oils, and carbohydrate-rich meals, the connection between these factors and metabolic diseases, or the potential long-term impacts on population comorbidities, as they have for criticizing egg yolks as a cause for cardiovascular disease in recent times. This review investigates the relationship between eggs and lipid levels, glucose levels, atherosclerosis, and antioxidant properties, as well as comparing them to cholesterol-free egg controls. We conducted the review in response to a recent trend of discarding nutritious and energy-rich egg yolks due to the belief propagated by the media that removing egg yolks from a normal diet is cardioprotective after the media started to blame egg yolks as the cause of the recent surge in heart attacks. However, the media fails to highlight the fact that eggs have been an integral part of the human diet since the domestication of hens. On the other hand, recent additions to the human diet a few decades ago, such as fructose-rich breakfast cereals, coffee beverages with sugar levels comparable to candy bars, protein supplements for diabetics that are notorious for raising blood glucose levels, and the heightened consumption of seed oil, which causes inflammation, have been responsible for the surge in cardiovascular events in recent times. Social media platforms often showcase visually appealing junk food products and sugary beverages as a sign of wealth, promoting unhealthy processed food and ultimately causing a decline in an individual's lifespan and overall health.","This review investigates the relationship between eggs and lipid levels, glucose levels, atherosclerosis, and antioxidant properties, as well as comparing them to cholesterol-free egg controls, in response to a recent trend of discarding nutritious and energy-rich egg yolks.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7d963659ad702560743d9d591fdb6f8fadd6e4ca,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/review_article/pdf/243375/20240509-3934-hlzkcy.pdf,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

Methods: Literature review was conducted on the relationship between nutritional, functional properties of eggs and serum cholesterol, as well as cardiovascular disease. Results: Eggs, which are a good protein food with complete amino acid composition, contain vitamin A, riboflavin, vitamin B12, folic acid, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, calcium, iron, choline, selenium, β-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, etc. However the egg yolk has a high cholesterol content, which is associated with chronic diseases, including heart disease and hypertension. As a result, its intake is subject to regulation. Outbreak of heart disease by yolk intake can show different results depending on the characteristics of the subjects, amount of egg intake, and the implications of other foods eaten. It is difficult to determine whether eggs are beneficial, as they are the main supplying source for other major nutritive elements as well. Several research studies insist that when cholesterol intake increases by 100 mg, the level of serum cholesterol increases by 2.2~4.5 mg/dL and when serum cholesterol increases by 1%, the risk of heart disease increases by 2%. This indicates that a large intake of eggs can increase the risk of heart disease. Although the cholesterol of egg yolk and serum cholesterol are correlated, it is insufficient to conclude that only cholesterol and not other components are related to heart disease. In fact, other components in egg such as various unsaturated fatty acids and phospholipids could be related as well. Rather than concluding egg as a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ food according to its cholesterol content, it is important to define egg as a part of dietary patterns. Conclusion: Generalizing an indiscriminate and uniform amount of egg intake for all seems inadequate. However, patients with diabetes or heart disease should pay particular attention to the amount of egg intake. As for the norm, eating egg with vegetables as a substitute for other animal products seems beneficial.","Although the cholesterol of egg yolk and serum cholesterol are correlated, it is insufficient to conclude that only cholesterol and not other components are related to heart disease, and it is important to define egg as a part of dietary patterns.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11ddb693f66152f828616f28a2ce659b9a60dd4c,None,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

As a result, it was reported that the dietary intake cholesterol did not affected cholesterol levels in blood. Moreover, it was reported that adding two eggs a day to a healthful diet did not significantly increase blood cholesterol levels in young or middle-aged men and women with normal or even moderately elevated blood cholesterol levels. Cholesterol feeding studies demonstrate that dietary cholesterol increases both LDL and HDL cholesterol with little change in the LDL : HDL ratio as an important risk indicator of heart disease. Especially a good indicator in the elderly from increased HDL-cholesterol, so cholesterol intake appeared to be good for the prevention of heart disease. Thus the consumption of eggs is bad for your health is not known as a fact, but rather was found to be effective in preventing heart disease. Also, all consumers may consume without worrying because there are no official standards regarding egg intake. Therefore, these evidences would clear up some misunderstanding and mistrust on egg cholesterol regarding the consumption of egg as well as give some desirable advice on how to maintain healthy life.","It was reported that adding two eggs a day to a healthful diet did not significantly increase blood cholesterol levels in young or middle-aged men and women with normal or even moderately elevated bloodolesterol levels, so cholesterol intake appeared to be good for the prevention of heart disease.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/faa6999dd39c63006ffaf7a7269cc1af927e5002,None,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

Di Pasquale, L. Sciulli, R. Marchioli",Giornale italiano di cardiologia,"In this review we have collected data from epidemiologic studies and clinical trials published from 1968 to 1989 on the relationship between dietary fat and risk of coronary heart disease. Although the reported observational studies of diet and coronary heart disease provide general support for the classic diet-heart hypothesis, evidence of specific dietary lipids is weak. A positive association with saturated fat intake was seen in two prospective studies. A positive association with cholesterol intake was found in only two cohort studies, and an inverse relationship with polyunsaturated fat intake in only one. Clear evidence from dietary trials in the prevention of coronary heart disease has not been found. The analysis of trends in coronary heart disease and stroke mortality of developed countries has shown a discrepancy between fat intakes, cholesterol levels and mortality. The reduction in intake of certain foods ""at high risk"" such as meat, eggs, milk and cheese, as a preventive intervention, is based on weak scientific evidence. A strategy program has to emphasize the maintenance of ideal body weight by caloric control, an adequate level of physical activity, and the control of other risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes.","Although the reported observational studies of diet and coronary heart disease provide general support for the classic diet-heart hypothesis, evidence of specific dietary lipids is weak and the reduction in intake of certain foods ""at high risk"" such as meat, eggs, milk and cheese, as a preventive intervention, is based on weak scientific evidence.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f84693c59da712919d5145387246b1a52107e1f0,None,eggs cholesterol heart disease review

For decades, health practitioners had been concern with the contribution of diet to an increase production of LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) level. However, research has shown that dietary cholesterol has a moderate contribution plasma LDL cholesterol concentration. Dietary cholesterol can increase the rate of oxidizing LDL-c, which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. It is then recommended by the American Heart Association to reduce dietary cholesterol intake by 300 mg per day. A meta-analysis has been done on prospective cohort studies to investigate further into the effects of egg consumption on coronary heart disease. Eggs are the major source of dietary cholesterol, which may consist up to 210 mg of cholesterol per egg. The recommended daily intake has been limited to one egg per day. However, eggs are low in calorie and have other nutrients that may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The meta-analysis consists of 17 reports, where there are 5,847 cases of coronary heart disease and 7,579 cases of stroke. Results showed that the consumption of eggs had no correlation between these cardiovascular disease and stroke, yet subjects with diabetes had a 25% lower risk of developing hemorrhagic stroke, and a significant increase in coronary heart disease when the consumption of eggs increased. This study did not describe whether or not the eggs in the study were organic. Fresh organic eggs are believed to cause lesser oxidation of LDL-c compared to the hormone-exposed eggs. To have a better understanding of why different studies have controversial results, researchers might need to question the source of the eggs.
