#### Key Findings:
- A shift from animal-based foods, including eggs, to plant-based foods is beneficially associated with cardiometabolic health and all-cause mortality.

**Methodology:** The study is a meta-analysis, which means it combines the results of multiple scientific studies. The main advantage of this approach is that it allows for a larger sample size and greater statistical power. The researchers likely identified relevant studies, extracted data, assessed study quality, and synthesized the findings to draw their conclusions.

**Limitations:** The main limitation of this study is that it does not provide specific information about the health effects of eggs on cardiovascular health. Instead, it groups eggs with other animal-based foods. Therefore, it is not possible to isolate the effects of egg consumption from the effects of consuming other animal-based foods. Additionally, as a meta-analysis, the study's findings are dependent on the quality of the included studies. If those studies have limitations, those limitations would also apply to this meta-analysis.

**Contribution:** This study contributes to our understanding of the topic by suggesting a potential negative association between egg consumption and cardiovascular health. However, more research is needed to confirm this association and to understand the specific effects of eggs on cardiovascular health.

**Relevance:** This study is relevant to the research topic because it includes eggs as part of the animal-based foods that it investigates. While it does not provide specific information about eggs, it suggests that reducing consumption of animal-based foods, including eggs, could be beneficial for cardiovascular health.

**Authors:** R. Weggemans, P. Zock, M. Katan

**Publication Venue:** American Journal of Clinical Nutrition

**Publication Date:** 2001-05-01

**Citations:** 346 (Influential Citations: 20)

**Access:** [PDF Available](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-pdf/73/5/885/23962934/885.pdf)
        
#### Key Findings:
- Dietary cholesterol raises the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol
- Dietary cholesterol increases total cholesterol concentrations by 0.056 mmol/L (2.2 mg/dL)
- Dietary cholesterol increases HDL-cholesterol concentrations by 0.008 mmol/L (0.3 mg/dL)
- The advice to limit cholesterol intake by reducing consumption of eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods may still be valid

**Methodology:** The researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 17 studies involving 556 subjects. The studies were identified through MEDLINE and Biological Abstracts searches and by reviewing reference lists. The studies included had a crossover or parallel design with a control group, and the experimental diets differed only in the amount of dietary cholesterol or number of eggs and were fed for > or =14 d.

**Limitations:** The study only included research that reported HDL-cholesterol concentrations, potentially excluding studies that focused on other aspects of cholesterol or cardiovascular health. Additionally, the study did not consider other dietary factors that could influence cholesterol levels.

**Contribution:** This study contributes to our understanding of the topic by providing a comprehensive analysis of the impact of egg consumption on cholesterol levels. It suggests that despite some studies finding no effect of egg consumption on coronary heart disease, eggs may still adversely affect cholesterol profiles due to their high cholesterol content.

**Relevance:** This study is relevant to the research topic as it directly investigates the impact of dietary cholesterol, specifically from eggs, on cholesterol levels and ratios, which are key indicators of cardiovascular health.

**Publication Venue:** Journal of the American College of Nutrition

**Publication Date:** 2004-12-01

**Citations:** 74 (Influential Citations: 4)

**Access:** PDF Not Available
        
#### Key Findings:
- Egg consumption is not associated with higher cholesterol levels in free-living populations.
- The epidemiologic literature does not support the idea that egg consumption is a risk factor for coronary disease.
- The most recent American Heart Association guidelines no longer include a recommendation to limit egg consumption.

**Methodology:** This is a review study that analyzed existing literature and guidelines related to egg consumption and cardiovascular health.

**Limitations:** As a review study, it does not conduct new experimental research but relies on the findings of previous studies. The quality of the review is therefore dependent on the quality and comprehensiveness of the studies included. Additionally, the study does not consider potential confounding factors that could influence the relationship between egg consumption and cardiovascular health.

**Contribution:** This paper contributes to our understanding of the topic by challenging the traditional view that egg consumption is a risk factor for coronary heart disease. It provides evidence that egg consumption is not associated with higher cholesterol levels and is not a risk factor for coronary disease, suggesting that eggs can be included in a healthy eating pattern.

**Relevance:** This paper is directly relevant to the research topic as it reviews the relationship between egg consumption and cardiovascular health, specifically coronary heart disease.

**Authors:** P. Xia, Xiong-Fei Pan, Chen Chen, Yi Wang, Y. Ye, A. Pan

**Publication Venue:** Journal of the American Heart Association : Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disease

**Publication Date:** 2020-05-13

**Citations:** 21 (Influential Citations: 0)

**Access:** [PDF Available](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.119.015743)
        
#### Key Findings:
- No significant association was found between additional daily consumption of half an egg and all‐cause mortality or heart disease mortality.
- Each 50‐mg/day increase of cholesterol intake was inversely associated with all‐cause mortality among participants with daily intake <250 mg, but positively associated with all‐cause mortality among participants with daily intake ≥250 mg.
- No significant association was found between dietary cholesterol intake and heart disease mortality.

**Methodology:** This was a prospective cohort study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2014, which included 37,121 participants ≥20 years of age. Dietary information was assessed via 24‐hour dietary recalls at baseline. Mortality status was documented until December 31, 2015. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations between dietary intakes of eggs and cholesterol and all‐cause and heart disease mortality.

**Limitations:** The study relied on self-reported dietary recalls, which may be subject to recall bias. The study also did not account for changes in dietary habits over time. Furthermore, the study did not differentiate between different types of eggs (e.g., free-range, organic, etc.) or cooking methods, which could potentially influence the health effects of eggs.

**Contribution:** This study contributes to our understanding of the topic by providing evidence that egg consumption does not significantly impact heart disease mortality. It also highlights the potential health risks associated with high levels of cholesterol intake, suggesting that the health effects of eggs on cardiovascular health may be more related to overall dietary cholesterol intake rather than egg consumption per se.

**Relevance:** This study is relevant to the research topic as it directly investigates the association between egg consumption, dietary cholesterol intake, and mortality, including heart disease mortality. The findings suggest that egg consumption does not significantly impact mortality rates, but high levels of cholesterol intake may be associated with increased all-cause mortality.

**Authors:** P. Jones

**Publication Venue:** International journal of clinical practice. Supplement

**Publication Date:** 2009-09-14

**Citations:** 42 (Influential Citations: 0)

**Access:** PDF Not Available
        
#### Key Findings:
- Consumption of up to seven eggs per week is harmonious with a healthful diet, except in male patients with diabetes for whom an association in higher egg intake and CHD was shown.
- The degree to which serum cholesterol is increased by dietary cholesterol depends upon whether the individual’s cholesterol synthesis is stimulated or down‐regulated by such increased intake, and the extent to which each of these phenomena occurs varies from person to person.
- The earlier purported adverse relationship between dietary cholesterol and heart disease risk was likely largely over‐exaggerated.

**Methodology:** This is a review paper that analyzed previous studies on the relationship between dietary cholesterol and coronary heart disease. It specifically highlighted the Harvard Egg Study conducted by Frank B. Hu of the Harvard School of Public Health in 1999.

**Limitations:** As a review paper, it does not present new experimental data but relies on the analysis of previous studies. The findings are therefore subject to the limitations of those studies. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the individual studies it reviews, making it difficult to assess the quality of the evidence it presents.

**Contribution:** This paper contributes to our understanding of the topic by challenging the widely held belief that egg consumption is detrimental to cardiovascular health. It suggests that the relationship between egg consumption and heart disease is not as straightforward as previously thought, and that individual factors such as a person's cholesterol synthesis can influence this relationship. It also highlights the need for more accurate and nuanced studies on this topic.

**Relevance:** This paper is relevant to the research topic as it directly addresses the health effects of eggs (a source of dietary cholesterol) on cardiovascular health. It provides a comprehensive review of previous studies, including the Harvard Egg Study, and presents a nuanced view of the relationship between egg consumption and cardiovascular health.

### Egg Consumption and Coronary Heart Disease: An Epidemiologic Overview (2000.0)
        
**Authors:** S. Kritchevsky, D. Kritchevsky

**Publication Venue:** Journal of the American College of Nutrition

**Publication Date:** 2000-10-01

**Citations:** 115 (Influential Citations: 2)

**Access:** PDF Not Available
        
#### Key Findings:
- Cholesterol intake was associated with a modest increase in the risk of coronary events.
- The association between cholesterol intake and heart disease risk was small (6% increase in risk for 200mg/1,000kcal/day difference in cholesterol intake).
- No association was seen between egg consumption at levels up to 1+ egg per day and the risk of coronary heart disease in non-diabetic men and women.

**Methodology:** This is an epidemiologic study that reviewed data relating dietary cholesterol and eggs to coronary disease risk. The study considered a full-range of confounding factors.

**Limitations:** The study acknowledges that the true magnitude of the association between cholesterol intake and heart disease risk is difficult to estimate because most studies fail to account for potential confounding by other features of the diet. Also, all but one of the studies reviewed failed to consider the role of other potentially confounding dietary factors when examining egg intake and its relationship with coronary outcomes.

**Contribution:** This paper contributes to our understanding of the topic by suggesting that while cholesterol intake may be associated with a modest increase in the risk of coronary events, egg consumption at levels up to 1+ egg per day does not appear to increase the risk of coronary heart disease in non-diabetic men and women, once other dietary factors are taken into account.

**Relevance:** This paper is relevant to the research topic as it directly investigates the relationship between egg consumption (and dietary cholesterol more broadly) and coronary heart disease risk.

**Access:** [PDF Available](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/7/9/5344/pdf?version=1441280991)
        
#### Key Findings:
- The evidence suggests that a diet including more eggs than is recommended may be used safely as part of a healthy diet in both the general population and for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease, those with established coronary heart disease, and those with T2DM.
- The disparity between dietary guidelines is at least in part related to the conflicting evidence as to the effects of eggs in the general population and in those with T2DM.

**Methodology:** This is a review paper, which means it synthesizes the findings of multiple studies on the topic of egg consumption and cardiovascular health. It addresses the effect of eggs on cardiovascular disease risk from both epidemiological research and controlled prospective studies, in people with and without cardio-metabolic disease.

**Limitations:** As a review paper, the findings are dependent on the quality and scope of the studies included in the review. The paper does not provide new primary research data, but rather interprets and synthesizes existing research. The paper also acknowledges that there is conflicting evidence on the topic, which may limit the conclusiveness of the findings.

**Contribution:** This paper contributes to our understanding of the topic by suggesting that a diet including more eggs than is typically recommended may be safe for both the general population and those at high risk of cardiovascular disease. It also highlights the need for nutrition guidelines to focus on a person’s entire dietary intake as opposed to specific foods or nutrients.

**Relevance:** This paper is directly relevant to the research topic as it reviews the effects of egg consumption on cardiovascular health, specifically in the general population and in those with T2DM.

**Authors:** M. Fernández

**Publication Venue:** Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care

**Publication Date:** 2012-03-01

**Citations:** 56 (Influential Citations: 2)

**Access:** PDF Not Available
        
#### Key Findings:
- Dietary cholesterol is not correlated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD).
- Dietary cholesterol challenges may increase plasma LDL cholesterol in certain individuals, who are more sensitive to dietary cholesterol (about one-quarter of the population), HDL cholesterol also rises resulting in the maintenance of the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, a key marker of CHD risk.
- The lines of evidence coming from current epidemiological studies and from clinical interventions utilizing different types of cholesterol challenges support the notion that the recommendations limiting dietary cholesterol should be reconsidered.

**Methodology:** This is a review study that analyzed recent evidence challenging the current dietary restrictions regarding cholesterol. It also examined the beneficial effects of eggs (an icon for dietary cholesterol) in healthy individuals. The study utilized data from epidemiological studies and clinical interventions.

**Limitations:** The study does not provide a detailed analysis of the individual studies it reviews. It also does not specify the types of clinical interventions used in the studies it reviews. Furthermore, the study does not differentiate between different types of dietary cholesterol, which could have different effects on cardiovascular health.

**Contribution:** This study contributes to our understanding of the topic by providing evidence that challenges the current dietary guidelines on cholesterol intake. It suggests that dietary cholesterol, such as that from eggs, may not be as harmful to cardiovascular health as previously thought. This could potentially lead to changes in dietary recommendations and guidelines.

**Relevance:** This study is relevant to the research topic as it directly addresses the health effects of dietary cholesterol, specifically from eggs, on cardiovascular health. It challenges the current dietary restrictions on cholesterol and suggests that these should be reconsidered.

**Authors:** S. Natoli, T. Markovic, David Lim, M. Noakes, K. Kostner

**Publication Venue:** nan

**Publication Date:** 2007-06-01

**Citations:** 27 (Influential Citations: 1)

**Access:** PDF Not Available
        
#### Key Findings:
- An increase in dietary cholesterol from eggs by 100 mg daily, equivalent to half a medium egg or three to four eggs a week, results in an increase of approximately 0.05 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol.
- Adding 100 mg of cholesterol per day (equivalent to three to four eggs a week) to a high saturated fat diet caused an increase in LDL cholesterol of 0.061 0.006 mmol/L, whereas adding the same quantity of cholesterol to a low saturated fat diet caused an increase in LDL cholesterol of only 0.036 0.004 mmol/L.
- Most epidemiological studies have shown little or no association between egg intake and risk of coronary heart disease.
- There is insufficient evidence to excessively restrict egg intake in a healthy Western population.

**Methodology:** The study is a review of existing literature on the effects of dietary cholesterol from eggs on serum cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease.

**Limitations:** The impact of dietary cholesterol for people with type 2 diabetes has been poorly studied. The study also does not consider the effects of egg consumption on other health conditions.

**Contribution:** The paper contributes to our understanding of the topic by providing a comprehensive review of the effects of egg consumption on cardiovascular health. It suggests that there is insufficient evidence to excessively restrict egg intake in a healthy Western population, and that eggs should be considered in a similar way as other protein-rich foods.

**Relevance:** The paper directly addresses the research topic by examining the effects of egg consumption on serum cholesterol levels and the risk of coronary heart disease. It provides a comprehensive review of existing literature on the topic.
