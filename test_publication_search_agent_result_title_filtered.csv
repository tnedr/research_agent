346,20,2001.0,2001-05-01,Dietary cholesterol from eggs increases the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in humans: a meta-analysis.,"R. Weggemans, P. Zock, M. Katan",American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,"BACKGROUND Several epidemiologic studies found no effect of egg consumption on the risk of coronary heart disease. It is possible that the adverse effect of eggs on LDL-cholesterol is offset by their favorable effect on HDL cholesterol. OBJECTIVE The objective was to review the effect of dietary cholesterol on the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. DESIGN Studies were identified by MEDLINE and Biological Abstracts searches (from 1974 to June 1999) and by reviewing reference lists. In addition, we included data from a more recently published study. Studies were included if they had a crossover or parallel design with a control group, if the experimental diets differed only in the amount of dietary cholesterol or number of eggs and were fed for > or =14 d, and if HDL-cholesterol concentrations were reported. Of the 222 studies identified, 17 studies involving 556 subjects met these criteria. RESULTS The addition of 100 mg dietary cholesterol/d increased the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol by 0.020 units (95% CI: 0.010, 0.030), total cholesterol concentrations by 0.056 mmol/L (2.2 mg/dL) (95% CI: 0.046, 0.065 mmol/L; 1.8, 2.5 mg/dL), and HDL-cholesterol concentrations by 0.008 mmol/L (0.3 mg/dL) (95% CI: 0.005, 0.010 mmol/L; 0.2, 0.4 mg/dL). CONCLUSIONS Dietary cholesterol raises the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and, therefore, adversely affects the cholesterol profile. The advice to limit cholesterol intake by reducing consumption of eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods may therefore still be valid.","Dietary cholesterol raises the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and, therefore, adversely affects the cholesterol profile, and the advice to limit cholesterol intake by reducing consumption of eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods may still be valid.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7660cf4d0d096ab585462f89b6c1cb0fc0d2d4c9,https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-pdf/73/5/885/23962934/885.pdf,eggs cholesterol heart disease review,14.416666666666666,0.2549742078113485,0.3235294117647059,0.0212478506509457,0.1820502261331946,0.9,meta-analysis,"The paper is about dietary cholesterol from eggs and its impact on cardiovascular health, which is directly related to the research topic."
74,4,2004.0,2004-12-01,A Review of Scientific Research and Recommendations Regarding Eggs,S. Kritchevsky,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,"For much of the past 40 years, the public has been warned away from eggs because of a concern over coronary heart disease risk. This concern is based on three observations: 1. eggs are a rich source of dietary cholesterol; 2. when fed experimentally, dietary cholesterol increases serum cholesterol and; 3. high serum cholesterol predicts the onset of coronary heart disease. However, data from free-living populations show that egg consumption is not associated with higher cholesterol levels. Furthermore, as a whole, the epidemiologic literature does not support the idea that egg consumption is a risk factor for coronary disease. Within the nutritional community there is a growing appreciation that health derives from an overall pattern of diet rather than from the avoidance of particular foods, and there has been a shift in the tone in recent dietary recommendations away from “avoidance” messages to ones that promote healthy eating patterns. The most recent American Heart Association guidelines no longer include a recommendation to limit egg consumption, but recommend the adoption of eating practices associated with good health. Based on the epidemiologic evidence, there is no reason to think that such a healthy eating pattern could not include eggs.","The most recent American Heart Association guidelines no longer include a recommendation to limit egg consumption, but recommend the adoption of eating practices associated with good health, and there is no reason to think that such a healthy eating pattern could not include eggs.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ba7a73c41c76d275a772900a49e44891cf151fad,,eggs cholesterol heart disease review,3.523809523809524,0.0545320560058953,0.4117647058823529,0.0051935291434186,0.1419664402238419,0.9,Review,Directly discusses eggs and cardiovascular health

Pan",Journal of the American Heart Association : Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disease,"Background The aim of this study was to identify associations between dietary intakes of eggs and cholesterol and all‐cause and heart disease mortality in a US population. Methods and Results Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2014 were used in this study, which included 37 121 participants ≥20 years of age. Dietary information was assessed via 24‐hour dietary recalls at baseline. Mortality status was documented until December 31, 2015. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the associations between dietary intakes of eggs and cholesterol and all‐cause and heart disease mortality. During a median follow‐up of 7.8 years, 4991 deaths were documented, including 870 deaths from heart disease. No significant association was observed between additional daily consumption of half an egg and all‐cause mortality (multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96–1.13), or heart disease mortality (0.96; 0.80–1.14). Each 50‐mg/day increase of cholesterol intake was inversely associated with all‐cause mortality among participants with daily intake <250 mg (0.87; 0.77–0.98), but positively associated with all‐cause mortality among participants with daily intake ≥250 mg (1.07; 1.01–1.12). No significant association was found between dietary cholesterol intake and heart disease mortality. Conclusions No significant association was found between egg consumption and mortality in US adults. The association between dietary cholesterol intake and all‐cause mortality depended on the baseline intake levels, with an inverse association in those with lower intake levels (<250 mg/day) but a positive association in those with higher intake levels (≥250 mg/day).","No significant association was found between egg consumption and mortality in US adults, and the association between dietary cholesterol intake and all‐cause mortality depended on the baseline intake levels, with an inverse association in those with lower intake levels (<250 mg/day but a positive association in Those with higher intake levels (≥250mg/day).",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00c58917adb935af89c7d67fa06f3de686612234,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.119.015743,eggs cholesterol heart disease review,4.2,0.0154753131908621,0.8823529411764706,0.0061901252763448,0.2718245264207378,0.8,prospective cohort study,"The paper is about dietary intakes of eggs and cholesterol in relation to cardiovascular health, which is directly related to the research topic."
42,0,2009.0,2009-09-14,Dietary cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients: a review of the Harvard Egg Study and other data,P. Jones,International journal of clinical practice. Supplement,"For many years, both the medical community and the general public have incorrectly associated eggs with high serum cholesterol and being deleterious to health, even though cholesterol is an essential component of cells and organisms. It is now acknowledged that the original studies purporting to show a linear relation between cholesterol intake and coronary heart disease (CHD) may have contained fundamental study design flaws, including conflated cholesterol and saturated fat consumption rates and inaccurately assessed actual dietary intake of fats by study subjects. Newer and more accurate trials, such as that conducted by Frank B. Hu of the Harvard School of Public Health (1999), have shown that consumption of up to seven eggs per week is harmonious with a healthful diet, except in male patients with diabetes for whom an association in higher egg intake and CHD was shown. The degree to which serum cholesterol is increased by dietary cholesterol depends upon whether the individual’s cholesterol synthesis is stimulated or down‐regulated by such increased intake, and the extent to which each of these phenomena occurs varies from person to person. Several recent studies have shed additional light on the specific interplay between dietary cholesterol and cardiovascular health risk. It is evident that the dynamics of cholesterol homeostasis, and of development of CHD, are extremely complex and multifactorial. In summary, the earlier purported adverse relationship between dietary cholesterol and heart disease risk was likely largely over‐exaggerated.","It is admitted that the original studies purporting to show a linear relation between cholesterol intake and coronary heart disease (CHD) may have contained fundamental study design flaws, including conflated cholesterol and saturated fat consumption rates and inaccurately assessed actual dietary intake of fats by study subjects.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0b39ed40f687257b0291a038a476c190e3677af,,eggs cholesterol heart disease review,2.625,0.0309506263817243,0.5588235294117647,0.0038688282977155,0.1784797780571329,0.8,review,"The paper is about dietary cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is directly related to the research topic."
115,2,2000.0,2000-10-01,Egg Consumption and Coronary Heart Disease: An Epidemiologic Overview,"S. Kritchevsky, D. Kritchevsky",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,"Serum cholesterol has been established as a modifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease. Experimental feeding studies show that saturated fat and cholesterol increase serum cholesterol levels; thus, dietary recommendations for lowering the risk of heart disease proscribe the intake of both substances. Recommendations have also included limits on the intake of eggs because of their high cholesterol content. In free-living populations, diet reflects a pattern of associated choices. Increases in one food may lead to changes in the consumption of other foods that may modulate disease risk. Epidemiologic data are helpful in assessing the importance of foods and nutrients in the context in which they are actually consumed. We review epidemiologic data relating dietary cholesterol and eggs to coronary disease risk. Cholesterol intake was associated with a modest increase in the risk of coronary events. The true magnitude of the association is difficult to estimate because most studies fail to account for potential confounding by other features of the diet. When a full-range of confounding factors was considered, the association between cholesterol intake and heart disease risk was small (6% increase in risk for 200mg/1,000kcal/day difference in cholesterol intake). Several studies have examined egg intake and its relationship with coronary outcomes. All but one failed to consider the role of other potentially confounding dietary factors. When dietary confounders were considered, no association was seen between egg consumption at levels up to 1+ egg per day and the risk of coronary heart disease in non-diabetic men and women.",,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/92c63d1f28ddeb505d3d1924eb78b418e60108d0,,eggs cholesterol heart disease review,4.6,0.0847457627118644,0.2941176470588235,0.0067796610169491,0.116370887337986,0.8,Epidemiologic study,Examines the relationship between egg consumption and coronary heart disease

Martin",Circulation,"Background: The American Heart Association, in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, annually reports the most up-to-date statistics related to heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular risk factors, including core health behaviors (smoking, physical activity, diet, and weight) and health factors (cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose control) that contribute to cardiovascular health. The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs). Methods: The American Heart Association, through its Epidemiology and Prevention Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update with review of published literature through the year before writing. The 2023 Statistical Update is the product of a full year’s worth of effort in 2022 by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. The American Heart Association strives to further understand and help heal health problems inflicted by structural racism, a public health crisis that can significantly damage physical and mental health and perpetuate disparities in access to health care, education, income, housing, and several other factors vital to healthy lives. This year’s edition includes additional COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) publications, as well as data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, with an enhanced focus on health equity across several key domains. Results: Each of the chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics.

The disparity between these guidelines is at least in part related to the conflicting evidence as to the effects of eggs in the general population and in those with T2DM. This review addresses the effect of eggs on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk from both epidemiological research and controlled prospective studies, in people with and without cardio-metabolic disease. It also examines the nutritional qualities of eggs and whether they may offer protection against chronic disease. The evidence suggests that a diet including more eggs than is recommended (at least in some countries) may be used safely as part of a healthy diet in both the general population and for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease, those with established coronary heart disease, and those with T2DM. In conclusion, an approach focused on a person’s entire dietary intake as opposed to specific foods or nutrients should be the heart of population nutrition guidelines.","The evidence suggests that a diet including more eggs than is recommended may be used safely as part of a healthy diet in both the general population and for those at high risk of cardiovascular disease, those with established coronary heart disease, and those with T2DM.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01845415d1d68356ffab5041add23115a76d9d7c,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/7/9/5344/pdf?version=1441280991,eggs cholesterol heart disease review,4.3,0.0316875460574797,0.7352941176470589,0.0063375092114959,0.2326295027959599,0.7,review,"The paper is about egg consumption and human cardio-metabolic health, which is directly related to the research topic."

Kor, S. Tyrovolas, A. Leung",European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing,"AIM Despite the well-documented short to medium-term effectiveness of eHealth (electronic health) secondary prevention interventions on patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), there is limited empirical evidence regarding long-term effectiveness. This review aims to evaluate the long-term effects of eHealth secondary prevention interventions on the health outcomes of patients with CVD. METHODS AND RESULTS This systematic review and meta-analysis followed Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. EMBASE, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched from 1990 to May 2022. Randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of eHealth secondary prevention on health outcomes of CVD patients that collected end-point data at ≥ 12 months were included. RevMan 5.3 was used for risk of bias assessment and meta-analysis. Ten trials with 1,559 participants were included. Data pooling suggested that eHealth programs have significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [n = 6; SMD = -0.26, 95%CI (-0.38, -0.14), I2 = 17%, p < .001]; systolic blood pressure [n = 5; SMD = -0.46, 95% CI, (-0.84, -0.08), I2 = 90%, p = 0.02]; and, re-hospitalization, reoccurrence, and mortality [RR = 0.36, 95% CI [0.17, 0.77], I2 = 0%, p = .009]. Effects on behavioral modification, physiological outcomes of body weight and blood glucose, and quality of life were inconclusive. CONCLUSION eHealth secondary prevention is effective in improving long-term management of risk factors and reducing the reoccurrence of cardiac events in patients with CVD. Results are inconclusive for behavior modification and quality of life. Exploring, implementing and strengthening strategies in eHealth secondary prevention programs that focus on maintaining behavior changes and enhancing psychosocial elements should be undertaken.

Fryer, U. Kadam, C. Chew‐Graham, M. Mamas",Circulation. Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes,"Background— Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disorder resulting in hypertension and multiorgan dysfunction. There is growing evidence that these effects persist after pregnancy. We aimed to systematically evaluate and quantify the evidence on the relationship between preeclampsia and the future risk of cardiovascular diseases. Methods and Results— We studied the future risk of heart failure, coronary heart disease, composite cardiovascular disease, death because of coronary heart or cardiovascular disease, stroke, and stroke death after preeclampsia. A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify relevant studies. We used random-effects meta-analysis to determine the risk. Twenty-two studies were identified with >6.4 million women including >258 000 women with preeclampsia. Meta-analysis of studies that adjusted for potential confounders demonstrated that preeclampsia was independently associated with an increased risk of future heart failure (risk ratio [RR], 4.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09–8.38), coronary heart disease (RR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.43–4.37), cardiovascular disease death (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.83–2.66), and stroke (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.29–2.55). Sensitivity analyses showed that preeclampsia continued to be associated with an increased risk of future coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke after adjusting for age (RR, 3.89; 95% CI, 1.83–8.26), body mass index (RR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.41–7.07), and diabetes mellitus (RR, 4.19; 95% CI, 2.09–8.38). Conclusions— Preeclampsia is associated with a 4-fold increase in future incident heart failure and a 2-fold increased risk in coronary heart disease, stroke, and death because of coronary heart or cardiovascular disease. Our study highlights the importance of lifelong monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia.","Preeclampsia is associated with a 4-fold increase in future incident heart failure and a 2-fold increased risk in coronary heart disease, stroke, and death because of coronary heart or cardiovascular disease.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0341a86781df4a1a114605145995686b08b70868,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.116.003497,eggs cardiovascular health meta-analysis,81.875,0.4826823876197494,0.7941176470588235,0.1206705969049373,0.4313082491655468,0.6,Meta-Analysis,Indirectly related to cardiovascular health

Fernández,Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,"Purpose of reviewThe perceived notion that dietary cholesterol is associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) has led to dietary recommendations of no more than 300 mg/day for healthy populations in the USA. This study will review the recent evidence that challenges the current dietary restrictions regarding cholesterol while it presents some beneficial effects of eggs (an icon for dietary cholesterol) in healthy individuals. Recent findingsThe European countries, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Korea and India among others do not have an upper limit for cholesterol intake in their dietary guidelines. Further, existing epidemiological data have clearly demonstrated that dietary cholesterol is not correlated with increased risk for CHD. Although numerous clinical studies have shown that dietary cholesterol challenges may increase plasma LDL cholesterol in certain individuals, who are more sensitive to dietary cholesterol (about one-quarter of the population), HDL cholesterol also rises resulting in the maintenance of the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, a key marker of CHD risk. SummaryThe lines of evidence coming from current epidemiological studies and from clinical interventions utilizing different types of cholesterol challenges support the notion that the recommendations limiting dietary cholesterol should be reconsidered.",The lines of evidence coming from current epidemiological studies and from clinical interventions utilizing different types of cholesterol challenges support the notion that the recommendations limiting dietary cholesterol should be reconsidered.,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/31bc76057ac190543cd403fef0d73d1a559d2ab9,,eggs cholesterol heart disease review,4.307692307692308,0.0412675018422991,0.6470588235294118,0.0063488464372767,0.209037436186424,0.6,review,"The paper is about rethinking dietary cholesterol, which is directly related to the research topic."

Michaud, R. Morgan",Noise and Health,"Background: Exposure to acute noise can cause an increase in biological stress reactions, which provides biological plausibility for a potential association between sustained noise exposure and stress-related health effects. However, the certainty in the evidence for an association between exposures to noise on short- and long-term biomarkers of stress has not been widely explored. The objective of this review was to evaluate the strength of evidence between noise exposure and changes in the biological parameters known to contribute to the development of stress-related adverse cardiovascular responses. Materials and Methods: This systematic review comprises English language comparative studies available in PubMed, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases from January 1, 1980 to December 29, 2021. Where possible, random-effects meta-analyses were used to examine the effect of noise exposure from various sources on stress-related cardiovascular biomarkers. The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the risk of bias of nonrandomized studies of exposures instrument. The certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results: The search identified 133 primary studies reporting on blood pressure, hypertension, heart rate, cardiac arrhythmia, vascular resistance, and cardiac output. Meta-analyses of blood pressure, hypertension, and heart rate suggested there may be signals of increased risk in response to a higher noise threshold or incrementally higher levels of noise. Across all outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was very low due to concerns with the risk of bias, inconsistency across exposure sources, populations, and studies and imprecision in the estimates of effects. Conclusions: This review identifies that exposure to higher levels of noise may increase the risk of some short- and long-term cardiovascular events; however, the certainty of the evidence was very low. This likely represents the inability to compare across the totality of the evidence for each outcome, underscoring the value of continued research in this area. Findings from this review may be used to inform policies of noise reduction or mitigation interventions.","Exposure to higher levels of noise may increase the risk of some short- and long-term cardiovascular events; however, the certainty of the evidence was very low, underscoring the value of continued research in this area.",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/61f9da40d16887238215fbfb8c528dfd30135b3b,,eggs cardiovascular health meta-analysis,4.333333333333333,0.0095799557848194,0.9411764705882352,0.0063866371898796,0.2877815827878682,0.6,Meta-Analysis,Indirectly related to cardiovascular health

Kostner",,"The role of dietary cholesterol in raising plasma cholesterol levels has been debated over the past 25 years. Consequently, eggs, as a food high in dietary cholesterol, have been targeted as a food to limit when advising patients on a diet to lower serum cholesterol levels. The aim of the present review was to evaluate the literature to address the effects of dietary cholesterol from eggs on serum cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease. An increase in dietary cholesterol from eggs by 100 mg daily, equivalent to half a medium egg or three to four eggs a week, results in an increase of approximately 0.05 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol. Adding 100 mg of cholesterol per day (equivalent to three to four eggs a week) to a high saturated fat diet caused an increase in LDL cholesterol of 0.061 0.006 mmol/L, whereas adding the same quantity of cholesterol to a low saturated fat diet caused an increase in LDL cholesterol of only 0.036 0.004 mmol/L (P = 0.03). Despite the small increase in LDL-cholesterol levels with increasing egg intake, most epidemiological studies have shown little or no association between egg intake and risk of coronary heart disease. However, the impact of dietary cholesterol for people with type 2 diabetes has been poorly studied. In conclusion, in a healthy Western population, there is insufficient evidence to excessively restrict egg intake as part of a healthy diet. Eggs should be considered in a similar way as other protein-rich foods and selected as part of a varied diet that is low in saturated fat and contains a variety of cardio-protective foods such as fish, wholegrains, fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts.",There is insufficient evidence to excessively restrict egg intake in a healthy Western population and eggs should be considered in a similar way as other protein-rich foods and selected as part of a varied diet that is low in saturated fat and contains a variety of cardio-protective foods.,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7e2d4c1ce0fb367cf28e9ff3da1e5f648c3cd0b,,eggs cholesterol heart disease review,1.5,0.0198968312453942,0.5,0.002210759027266,0.1568533529845246,0.5,review,"The paper is about eggs, serum cholesterol, and coronary heart disease, which is directly related to the research topic."
